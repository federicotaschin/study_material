## Projects
This directory contains my projects in Machine Learning

### classification-perceptron.py
Python script that does classification of labeled 2-dimensional data using the perceptron method.
This is very simple but it,s a good point to start understanding the issues in calssification problems.
You can read about the Perceptron method in the [Mit Machine Learning Open Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-867-machine-learning-fall-2006/lecture-notes/)

### linear_regression_livegraph
Contains a JavaScript that shows the Gradient Descent algorithm in action on a Linear Regression problem. 
This script can be run on my post: [Gradient Descent online example](https://fedetask.com/linear-regression-visualization-tool/).
