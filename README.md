# This is my study material
## Lectures, links, projects.
Started on 4-11-2018
I'm a computer engineer working in Eindhoven as internee. I'll publish here everything I'll sutdy in my off-time.
For each topic I will add a folder with the topics name. Its content could be text, videos, code, pdf and many other. I will update this readme file to describe the folder structures as I go on studying. 

Hope this will be useful to someone else
